# Earthquake Missing Individuals Reunification

## Introduction

Finding missing individuals in the aftermath of an earthquake poses significant challenges for concerned family members. Despite advancements in technology, people still rely on outdated methods to locate their loved ones during such critical situations. This thesis project aims to address this pressing issue by developing an innovative solution that harnesses the power of deep learning and cloud systems, specifically employing face recognition techniques. 

## Key Features

- **Face Recognition:** Our solution uses cutting-edge face recognition powered by machine learning models to accurately identify and match individuals, providing a reliable means of locating loved ones amidst the chaos following an earthquake.
- **Real-time Processing:** Integration of ML Kit and TensorFlow Lite ensures real-time face recognition capabilities on Android devices, optimizing performance and ensuring swift results.
- **Cloud Integration:** Utilization of cloud systems such as HuaweiCloud Firebase enables seamless data storage, synchronization, and sharing. Relevant information, including photos, descriptions, and last known locations, can be readily accessible to concerned families.

## Goals

The primary goal of this project is to contribute to the field of disaster response by bridging the gap between outdated methods and the potential of emerging technologies. The development of an Android application that combines face recognition, deep learning, and cloud systems has the potential to revolutionize the process of finding missing individuals after earthquakes. By providing a faster and more efficient solution, we strive to alleviate the anguish experienced by families in times of crisis and enable a swifter reunification process, bringing much-needed relief and peace of mind to those affected by such devastating events.

## Implementation

The proposed solution is implemented within an Android application, integrating ML Kit, TensorFlow Lite, FaceNet, and HuaweiCloud Firebase. The scalable and secure infrastructure offered by cloud systems enhances the efficiency and reliability of the solution, supporting the seamless coordination of efforts during the reunification process.
